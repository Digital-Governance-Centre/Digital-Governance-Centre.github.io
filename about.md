# About

Across Europe, developing a better understanding of the process of digital innovation and transformation is becoming increasingly important. At the same time, there is also a clear desire for such innovations and transformations to integrate shared European values and human rights as core components for our shared sustainable and digital future. Yet, most work today places a heavy focus only on the processes and infrastructure needed for idea generation and the development of innovative digital solutions, while simultaneously ignoring the additionally necessary question of  how can such digital innovations be scaled up?  

The Scaling-up Public Sector Digital Innovations in Europe project will address this question.

In conjunction with the McKinsey Centre for Government, a team from the Hertie Schoolâ€™s Centre for Digital Governance led by Prof. Dr Gerhard Hammerschmid, will:
*	generate understanding and knowledge related to scaling up public sector digital innovations in Europe.
*	undertake a meta-analysis of state-of-the-art research in scaling up public sector digital innovations in Europe.
*	conduct in depth case studies of innovation scaling successes (and potential failures)
*	create and develop a theoretical and conceptual framework that will allow for a systematic mapping and analysis of scaling up digital innovations in the public sector.
*	author a report and policy brief that offer a cohesive and comprehensive overview on the topic of scaling up public sector digital innovations.
The project will focus on identifying and analysing a number of successfully scaled up digital innovations within Germany and across Europe.
